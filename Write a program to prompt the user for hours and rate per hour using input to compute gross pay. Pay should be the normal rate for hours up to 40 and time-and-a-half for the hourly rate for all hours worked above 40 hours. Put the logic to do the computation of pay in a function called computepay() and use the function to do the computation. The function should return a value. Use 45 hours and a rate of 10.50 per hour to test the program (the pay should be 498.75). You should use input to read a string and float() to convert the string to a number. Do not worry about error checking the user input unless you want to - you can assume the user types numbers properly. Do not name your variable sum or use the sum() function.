Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Pay should be the normal rate for hours up to 40 and time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. Put the logic to do the computation of pay in a function called computepay() and use the function to do the computation. The function should return a value. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking the user input unless you want to - you can assume the user types numbers properly. Do not name your variable sum or use the sum() function



INPUT:

def computepay(h,r):
    if h > 40:
        p = 1.5 * r * (h - 40) + (40 *r)
    else:
        p = h * r
    return p

hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
hr = float(hrs)
rphrs = input("Enter rate per hour:")
rphr = float(rphrs)

p = computepay(hr,rphr)
print("Pay", p)

OUTPUT:
Pay 498.75
