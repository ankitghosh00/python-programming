 Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'. Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the number. Enter 7, 2, bob, 10, and 4 and match the output below.
 
 
 
 INPUT:
 
 largest = None
smallest = None
while True:
    num = input("Enter a number: ")
    if num == "done": break
    try:
        num = int(num)
        if largest is None or largest < num: largest = num
        if smallest is None or smallest > num: smallest = num
    except:
        print ("Invalid input")
        continue
print ("Maximum is",largest)
print ("Minimum is",smallest)


OUTPUT:
Invalid input
Maximum is 10
Minimum is 2
